# Automatic SFDP Generator (ASG)

Automatic SFDP generator is a tool for creating a new Shared Federated Data Product (SFDP) that provides a specified subset of the data exposed by the existing Federated Data Product (FDP).
The details of when and how the ASG tool is used as part of TEADAL is described in more detail in TEADAL documentation.
Here, we describe the ASG installation to a TEADAL federation. 
Note that ASG is a tool that can be installed on one of the TEADAL nodes in the TEADAL Federation in order to serve the whole fededation.
